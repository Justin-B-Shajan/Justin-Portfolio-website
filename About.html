                    Hello! I'm <strong>Justin B Shajan</strong>, a passionate <strong>Web Developer</strong> and <strong>Cybersecurity Enthusiast</strong>.  
                    I specialize in building secure, high-performance web applications with expertise in both front-end and back-end technologies.

                <p class="slide-up">
                    I have hands-on experience with various tools such as <strong>Wireshark, Metasploit, and Nmap</strong> and have participated in several security assessments and vulnerability analyses.
                    Iâ€™m constantly learning and evolving to stay ahead in the ever-changing cybersecurity landscape. My aim is to help organizations stay secure by identifying weaknesses and providing solutions.

                <p class="slide-up">
                    My interest in ethical hacking started early when I became fascinated by how systems work and how vulnerabilities can be exploited. Since then, I have dedicated my time to ethical hacking, focusing on responsible security practices.

                <p class="slide-up">
                    In my free time, I enjoy participating in <strong>Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges</strong>, experimenting with security tools, and writing about cybersecurity techniques.
                    My goal is to become a top cybersecurity professional, helping organizations secure their infrastructure. I am also working towards earning my <strong>CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)</strong> certification.
